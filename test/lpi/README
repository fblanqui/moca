The LPI example: in this complex case, we absolutely need to define a special
comparison in order to correctly normalize the terms.

- The directory src contains the original example with semi-automatic
generation of construction functions (the result of mocac has been hand
edited).

- The sub-directory src/examples contains 2 examples that should run correctly
if everything is ok.

This lpi directory should contain a new version that automatically generates the
correct construction functions using the new mocac compiler.

This lpi directory should share all the files from src, except for the two
files semi_algebra.mli and semi_algebra.ml that must now be generated by mocac
from the source file semi_algebra.mlm.

Additional note (07/10/16):
 - semi_algebra.mlm is slightly edited to precise the comparison used for
   comutative operators.
 - since the compiler modifies details (parens and the like) that leads to
   difficult diffs, a new hand corrected and (presumably) correct file is given:
   semi_algebra.ml.hand; it oasses tests successfully.
