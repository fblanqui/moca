1) To quickly test something, use the specialized script shell ocaml_test.
==========================================================================

To run and perform test in file test.ml, just launch

$ ocaml_test < test.ml

Contents of file test is the following:

#load "gentest.cmo";;
open Gentest;;
#load "group_2.cmo";;
open Group_2;;
#use "tgroup_2.ml";;

let _minus_one = ~- one;;
let x = _2 + _1;;
_minus_one + x;;

You may easily adapt test.ml to your needs :)
