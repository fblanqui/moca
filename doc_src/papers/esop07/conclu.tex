\label{sec-futur}

We plan to integrate \moca\ to the development environment \focal\
\cite{focal0.3.1}. \focal\ units contain declarations and
definitions of functions, statements and proofs as first-class
citizens. Their compilation produces both a file checkable by the
theorem prover \coq\ \cite{coq8.0} and a \ocaml\ source code. Proofs
are done either within \coq\ or via the automatic theorem prover
\zenon\ \cite{zenon0.4.1}, which issues a \coq\ file when it
successes. Every \focal\ unit has a special field, giving the type of
the data manipulated in this unit. Thus, it would be very interesting
to do a full integration of private/relational data types in \focal,
the proof of correctness of construction functions being done with
\zenon\ or \coq\ and then recorded as a theorem to be used for further
proofs. This should be completed by the integration of a tool on
rewriting and equational theories able to complete equational
presentations, to generate and prove the corresponding lemmas and to
show some termination properties. Some experiments already done within
\focal\ on coupling \cime\ \cite{cime2.02} and \zenon\ give a serious
hope of success.
