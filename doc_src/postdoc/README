Directory contents
==================

This directory contains a bunch of helper files to enhance the documentation
produced by OCamldoc.

* jquery.js contains a version of the JQuery library used by the other scripts;
* improve.js rewrites the html produced by OCamldoc, mostly by using well-named
  div classes;

* style.css refines the basic OCamldoc CSS stylesheet;

* process.sh is a shell script called by the global Makefile to do the work
  automagically.
